# WeShift Dashboard Project
Web 2 Course - An-Najah National University. <br>
Supervisor: Doc. Abed Natsheh <br>
Prepared by Exceeds Team

## Problem Statement
WeShift is a company that created a website for solving transportation issues using technologies such as Google maps, road timers, and online payments.<br> 
It finds a suitable taxi for the ride. This happens by adding the current location as well as the destination. Then, WeShift selects the nearest taxi car for this order, displays the expected arrival time as well as the cost. Finally, the customer pays with a credit card and enjoys the ride. <br>
For management purposes, the WeShift company would like to analyze its data. They used to do this by hand, but it didn't provide them with all of the information they needed, and it took a long time. As a result, our solution is to create an up-to-date dashboard for their data

## Project Description
// Need here to update

In our project we're going to build a dashboard for WeShift company, this dashboard is accessible by moderators. <br>
There are four main sections:
* Homepage: contains general data, such as the number of drivers and users, the most active drivers, the most ordered places, the most used services, and the average of payments by customers.
* Customer: contains specific data about each customer, such as phone number, customer's full name, number of orders, city, and the customer with the most number of orders.
* Driver: contains data about drivers in general, such as sorting drivers from the ones with the highest number of requests to the lowest. Also, it contains data about each driver, such as name, city, phone number, email, salary, car ID, and the number of requests.
* Cars: contains data about each car, such as the car number, car model, type of car, year of release, insurance, license, car driver, and car expenses.

In this project, we're working on the authentication for the user and driver to get their data displayed in the dashboard.
