## Introduction
### Background Information
Waiting is a problem that we face daily, and it has become a lifestyle for many of us, especially when it comes to transportation. According to studies, we spend around 6 months of our lives waiting in and for transportation. Every day, people in Palestine wait for taxis for an average of 00:05 to 00:25 minutes. This issue has a variety of causes, ranging from crisis problems to a lack of taxi service in particular areas. As a result, numerous appointments and plans have been rescheduled or canceled. <br>
As we get closer to the typical Palestinian taxi service, we notice that there are two options: either wait in the street for a taxi or order one from a taxi office and wait for it to arrive, but at a higher cost. 

### Problem Statement
We, as students and residents, face various problems in the traditional Palestinian taxi service on a daily basis.Â 
* Long wait for a taxi to arrive or to catch a taxi.
* Changing prices based on the length of the ride or a traffic jam; Time spent looking for a new location.
 
### Project Description
WeShift is a new transportation service that makes things easier! . <br>
WeShift is a website that uses technologies like Google Maps, RoadTimers, and Online Payments to find the best taxi for a specific ride. <br>
When I want a ride as a customer, I register to the website, add my exact current location as well as the destination. Then WeShift selects the nearest by taxi car to accept my order, and displays the expected arrival time as well as the cost. So, once everything is completed, I pay with a credit card and enjoy the ride. <br>
