### Information we want to be able to display in our pages

### Define appropriate URLs (URL handlers) for returning resources

### Main Flow
The diagram below is provided as a reminder of the main flow of data and things that need to be implemented when handling an HTTP request/response. In addition to the views and routes the diagram shows "controllers" â€” functions that separate out the code to route requests from the code that actually processes requests.
![Main Flow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/routes/mvc_express.png)

* "Routes" to forward the supported requests (and any information encoded in request URLs) to the appropriate controller functions.
* Controller functions to get the requested data from the models, and return response to the user to view in the browser.
